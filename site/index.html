      Chickpea Bake
    </h2>
    <p>
      This might be the best dish of the Quarantine. Here is the recipe:
    </p>
    <h3>
      Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>3/4 cup</b> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li><b>1/4 cup</b> finely diced onion</li>
      <li><b>2 cans</b> chickpease, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li><b>1/4 cup</b> capers, drained</li>
      <li>Big Pinches sea salt and fresh black pepper</li>
      <li><b>3 sprigs</b> fresh thyme (rosemary is good, too)</li>
      <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> chile flakes</li>
      <li><b>1/4 cup</b> cured black olives (do not add this to my recipe, gross)</li>
      <li><b>1/2</b> lemon</li>
      <li><b>1/2 cup</b> crumbled feta</li>
      <li>Smoky paprika, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Steps:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 375&deg F.</li>
      <li>In a small skillet over medium heat, add a splash of the olive oil. When it's hot, add the onions and saut√© until softening and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and scrape into a baking dish: Use an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 if you want softer chickpeas and a 9 x 13 if you'd prefer some get a tad bit crispy on the bottom. </li>
      <li>Add the remaining olive oil, chickpeas, capers, salt, pepper, thyme, chile flakes, olives, and lemon slices to the dish, then stir to combine. Cover tightly with foil and bake 35 to 45 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling and the chickpeas are soft.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil, add the crumbled feta and paprika, and allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving with (or on top of) bread.</li>
    </ol>
